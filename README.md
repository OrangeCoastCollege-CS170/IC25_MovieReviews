# IC25_MovieReviews

Write a Java program that will read a text file (named MovieReviews.txt) that contains an unknown number of movie review scores, one per line.  For example the file contents might look like:

3.5
4.0
5.0
2.5
3.0
1.5
1.0
3.0

Read the scores in as double values and store them in an ArrayList.  Compute and display the number of movie reviews and the average review score.

Please make up your own text file (MovieReviews.txt) and fill it with scores.
